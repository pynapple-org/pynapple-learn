# Instantiating a `Tsd` object

At the heart of pynapple are time series object. The simplest one is the 
[Tsd](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.Tsd.html#pynapple.Tsd) for
Time Series Data. 
The `Tsd` object represent one-dimensional time series. It needs two arguments :

- `t` : the timestamps
- `d` : the data

**Question** : Can you instantiate a `Tsd` object called `tsd`. Note : every pynapple
objects are at the root of the namespace.
